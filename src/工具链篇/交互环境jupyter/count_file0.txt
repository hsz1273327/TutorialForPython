# Apache Spark

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, and Python, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured
data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
